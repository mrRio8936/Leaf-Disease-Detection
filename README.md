# Plant Disease Detection

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning application for detecting diseases in plants through image classification. Using a deep learning model, it classifies plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories, helping farmers and plant enthusiasts identify and address plant health issues early.

The project includes a frontend interface built with **Streamlit** and uses **Keras** for the deep learning model, which is trained on a dataset of plant images.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Detects diseases in plant leaves from uploaded images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Provides training scripts and test images.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes training history and model accuracy.
